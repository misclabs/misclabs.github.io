# Misc. Labs

Misc. Labs is a single human studio doing miscellaneous experiments in games, graphics, sounds, and programming.

Misc. Labs is pronounced "miscellaneous labs", but if you say "misk labs" I'll know what you mean.

The main site is https://misclabs.com and the sites source is at https://github.com/misclabs/misclabs.github.io

## Tools, Libraries, Feature

These are some useful tools, libraries, and features I use to make stuff.

## Website
The website is mostly vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript with some experiments using WebGL. I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing and test mostly in [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with a local [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

[Marked](https://marked.js.org/) is used for markdown rendering.

CSS is built on top of [CSS-Mint](https://arunmichaeldsouza.github.io/CSS-Mint/)

The best reference for Javascript I've found is [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)

The single best resource for WebGL has been [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/)

## Games
For something bite size [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/) is especially fun and worth checking out.

I've used Unreal and Unity professionally, but left to my own devices I like to make things using smaller C/C++ libraries. For editing and debugging I use [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). I use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building which is not ideal, but whatever.

[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) - if you're unsure this is where I would start

[nothings stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) single header libraries

If you want to learn to make a game from scratch [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) is a fantastic resource. I haven't made it very far through the videos, and I've still learned a lot.

For game assets [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) is always the first stop.

[itch.io](https://itch.io/) is a fantastic place to publish games (and find new games to play!web)
